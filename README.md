# Front End Learning

The aim of this repository is to re familiarise myself with some of the basic features of HTML, CSS and javascript. I am using and following a pre planned roadmap for front-end developers to help me understand the order in which to learn. My aim is to master the basics that I first learned over 2 years ago, whilst learning new techniques and features that I was unaware of. I want to be able to create responsive, well designed, and stylish web pages using the tools that I learn throughout this process. Effectively, this repository is serving as a playground for me to mess about with some of the functionalities that I am not used to. So far I have not only consolidated my knowledge of HTML and CSS, but learned about adding event listeners, and styling with flexbox and grid layouts. 

## To Do List

I am keeping an organised list of things I need to learn / feel like I have covered, on a Trello board found [here](https://trello.com/b/hsiiKyaX/front-end-path). I will be updating this board as I go along.
